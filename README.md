# üçï Pizza API Challenge

## Project Description

This application is a RESTful Pizza API built with Flask, following the MVC (Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìController) architecture. It manages restaurants, pizzas, and the relationships between them, allowing users to:

- List, create, and delete restaurants.
- List all pizzas.
- Create and list restaurant-pizza relationships, including price validation.
- Cascade delete all related restaurant-pizza records when a restaurant is deleted.

The API is designed for easy integration with frontend clients and supports robust validation and error handling. It includes a database seeding script, migration support, and a Postman collection for testing all endpoints. The project is ideal for learning or demonstrating best practices in Flask API development, database relationships, and clean project structure.
